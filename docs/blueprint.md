# **App Name**: LawHelp AI

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Firebase Authentication to manage user sign-up and sign-in with no email/OTP verification.
- AI Chatbot: An AI chatbot tool that takes user input about their issue, then returns potential case types (civil/criminal), section numbers, and small explanations. LLM should only provide real articles or parts thereof.
- Complaint Form: Users can enter details about their problem via a form and submit it.  The form data is stored for review. This information is only accessible to the organization, but users may see a 'status' for a submitted request.
- Homepage: A basic static front page will welcome the user to the application. 
- Navigation: Standard navigation and links. Ensure consistent look and feel across pages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2E4A62), reminiscent of government websites, conveying trust and authority.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), provides a clean and professional backdrop, ensuring readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#45A0A2), to add a touch of modernity and highlight key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, maintaining a clean, modern, and easily readable style throughout the platform.
- Use simple, clear, and professional icons. Icons should follow the teal and blue palette.
- Clean and structured layout with ample whitespace for ease of navigation. Align with standard legal document formats to enhance familiarity and trust.
- Subtle transition animations to improve user experience. Example: loading bars and progress indicators.
